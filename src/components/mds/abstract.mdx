# Abstract

This paper presents GeoAgent, a model capable of reasoning closely with humans and deriving fine-grained address conclusions. 
Previous RL-based methods have achieved breakthroughs in performance and interpretability but still remain concerns because of their reliance on AI-generated chain-of-thought (CoT) data and training strategies, which conflict with geographic characteristics. 
To address these issues, we first introduce GeoSeek, a new geolocation dataset comprising CoT data annotated by geographic experts and professional players.
We further thoroughly explore the inherent characteristics of geographic tasks and propose a geo-similarity reward and a consistency reward assessed by  a consistency agent to assist training. 
This encourages the model to converge towards correct answers from a geographic perspective while ensuring the integrity and consistency of its reasoning process. 
Experimental results show that GeoAgent outperforms existing methods and a series of general VLLMs across multiple grains, while generating reasoning that closely aligns with humans.
