# Framework

![](./pipeline3.png)

**Data construction and training pipeline of GeoAgent.** GeoSeek-CoT contains 10k high-quality reasoning processes labeled by geography experts and geolocation game players. 
  GeoSeek-Loc includes 20k images for the cold start **of GeoAgent-SFT.** During the GRPO-based training, based on **GeoAgent-SFT**, we design the geo-similarity reward to encourage the model to converge towards correct answers both physically and semantically. 
  Also, the consistency reward is introduced to keep the integrity and consistency of CoT.

# GeoSeek Dataset

![](./teaser.png)

**GeoSeek Dataset.** We train GeoAgent with GeoSeek, a geolocation dataset with bias-reducing sampling and a val-bench annotated with locatability and geographic elements. Remarkably, a single image may contain multiple geographic elements.

<img src="./data.png" style={{ display: "block", width: "80%", maxWidth: "80%", margin: "0 auto" }} />

GeoSeek consists of three parts: GeoSeek-CoT, GeoSeek-Loc, and GeoSeek-Val. GeoSeek-CoT contains 10K high-quality reasoning processes labeled by humans, used for SFT. GeoSeek-Loc contains 20K samples with fine-grained address annotations, used for GRPO. GeoSeek-Val serves as a benchmark for evaluating geolocation models, with each image labeled for locatability and the geographic clues available for localization.

# Comparison

![](./ccase.png)

**Reasoning comparison of six different models (GPT-5, Gemma3, Kimi, Qwen2.5-VL-32B, GeoAgent, and GeoAgent with only SFT).**

- **Green**: correct reasoning  
- **Yellow**: reasoning with certain issues  
- **Red**: reasoning that deviates significantly  
- **Brown**: highlights instances where the reasoning process is **incomplete** or **inconsistent** with the result.

{/* ### Nice (H3)

[**Diffusion models**](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-07-11-diffusion-models/) are a class of generative models in machine learning that have gained significant attention in recent years. 

**Text-to-image diffusion models** have various application scenarios, including:

- **Art & Design**: Used by artists for creative art and fashion designers to generate clothing renderings.
- **Advertising & Marketing**: Helps in creating advertising posters and product promotion maps.
- **Game & Film**: Applied in game scene and character design, as well as film and television concept design...

> Thegeneral training steps of diffusion models are as follows:

1. Data collection
2. Noise addition
3. Model building
4. Training
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment


```
import torch 

def denoise():
    pass

Lift ($$L$$) can be determined by Lift Coefficient ($$C_L$$) like the following
equation.

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L
$$
